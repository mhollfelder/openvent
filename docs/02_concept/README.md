# System overview

## System diagram

An overview of the basic system components can be found in the following system diagram.
The overall system is split into the following high-level blocks:

- Mechanics
- Hardware peripherals
- Core hardware
- Software

These overarching blocks are broken each broken down to sub-components.\
Currently, work and documentation is also split along these dimensions and blocks.

| Mechanics        | Hardware peripherals      | Core hardware           | Software      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Pneumantics      | User interaction elements | Microcontroller         | Base system   |
| Motor            | Sensing                   | Communication interface | Safety logics |
| Compression unit | Power supply              |                         | Control logic |
| Bag valve mask   | Motor power stage         |                         | Algorithms    |
| Fixture          | Motor control             |                         |               |

Please check our development flow here to see how these components are developed and synced to each other

## Bill of Material (BOM) selection

The BOM for the device depends on the respective prototype.\
Please check out the respective prototype pages as well for more information.\
